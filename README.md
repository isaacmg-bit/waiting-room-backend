## Background

Waiting Room was developed as the foundational module set for 'Waiting Room' — a platform where musicians can organize their agenda, discover rehearsal spaces and venues near them, and connect with other artists.

The application explores Angular Signals, reactive state management, REST API integration with NestJS and MongoDB Atlas, interactive maps with Leaflet, data visualization with Chart.js and event management with FullCalendar.
